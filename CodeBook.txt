The dataset "my_tidy_data" was obtained by processing the dataset downloaded from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip.
This dataset comes from processing the mesurements obtained as explained in:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.

The original dataset is divided in two datasets named "test" and "train". From each of these I have used X, y and subject files, and also the features.txt. After merging the X files into a dataframe with 10299 observation of 561 variables, I have selected only the variables containing "mean" or "std", which means 79 variables.
I have completed the above dataframe with two other variables: subject and activity.
Finally, this dataframe was grouped by subject and by activity and summarized, resulting a dataframe with 35 observations and 81 variables.
The first two variables are subjects and activity, used for grouping, for the other 79 the average was computed. In each row the 79 variables represents the average corresponding to one subject for one activity.
The list of the variables are as follows:
1 subjects
	numbers from 1 to 30, identifiing the 30 subjects
2 activity
	the names of the 6 activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.
The 79 variables from 3 to 81 are the averages of the original variables for each subject and each activity. The units and meaning are as provided in the original dataset.
